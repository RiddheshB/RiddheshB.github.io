### How to start a blog for free and start writing

First, to just write. Getting started is more important (especially for Ti users, we need more of your thoughts out in the world)

- Notes app in your phone 
- A diary
- Your facebook wall 
- Your society's notice board 

#### How to start blogging without Blogger or using Google
This shouldn't take more than 30 minutes
- (optional) Buy your domain name (Porkbun, Hover, Cloudfare Domains)
- Create a Github Account 
- [Follow these instructions](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)
- Start writing!
	- Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It's the best writing app that is highly customisable & respects your privacy

#### Linking Github Pages
- A bit more complex. Try asking the 'tech-guy' of your family to do this. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX4w9hsduNA)

#### Adding comments feature 
- Your website would be incomplete without a comment section (or would it?)
	- [Click here](https://github.com/apps/utterances). Choose your page repo (`username.github.io`) 
	- You'll be redirected to a page. Copy the code at the bottom. Paste it in your `post.html` (In Layouts folder)

#### What should I write about?
Anything. 

Like a river creating tributaries, you'll notice your mind will flow with new ideas once you start writing.

(This was the first time I used the word 'tributary' other than my 7th Grade Geography Exam) 

Who knew studying Geography would come handy one day? The [[dots]] only make sense looking back
